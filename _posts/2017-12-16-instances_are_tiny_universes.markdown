When I first started exploring the realm of coding I remember thinking that it was fun solving the puzzles and creating fun algorithms to do simple functions like storing data and sorting but the functionality seemed limited. When I hit the object oriented section of Ruby it felt like the possibilities became endless. My coding existence was no longer limited and possibilities were only limited by imagination and time. Programs and websites started popping into my head and I could understand the basics of video game creation. Characters are their own objects and own different skills. A priest couldn't cleave like a warrior because they didn't have access to that method! The lamp next to the couch would have attributes like 'temperature', 'status', and 'usage time'. In fact, instances could be as large or small as you needed them to be. This universe is an instance and every item within it a smaller instance as well. Instances are their own tiny universes. So maybe we are living in a computer simulation or maybe it is because purpose behind programming that makes it immitate life so accurately albeit abstractly. 

Either way this is now I see everything now. Objects with attributes.
